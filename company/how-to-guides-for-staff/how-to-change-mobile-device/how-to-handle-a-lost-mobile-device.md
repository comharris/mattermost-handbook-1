# How to handle a lost mobile device

In the event of a lost mobile device, please report it immediately to the company security team via [security@mattermost.com](mailto:security@mattermost.com), or via the [Security Team channel](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/security-team). Make sure to include the mention "@securityteam" in your message to notify the security team.

The security team will assist you in removing access from your lost mobile device to your Mattermost resources, and walk you through the set up of a new mobile device.
